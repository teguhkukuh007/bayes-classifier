The story is a narrative of the twilight months of the infamous James Gang portayed through the deteriorating relations of the few remaining gang members struggling to maintain a semblance of normal life set against a stark Missouri winter landscape. Years of crime, violence, and life in seclusion have taken their toll on the physical and mental health of the characters, especially Jesse James (Brad Pitt) who exhibits increasing paranoia and unpredictability.Young Bob Ford (Casey Affleck) has grown up worshiping the legend of Jesse James and through his older brother Charley's (Sam Rockwell) affiliation, is introduced to the 34 year old James. The young man longs to prove his mettle to his larger-than-life idol. As he becomes increasingly exposed to the real personna, an inevitable disillusionment takes root.The story turns when Bob is drawn into the middle of an adulterous feud between Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner) and Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider). Ford spontaneously guns down Hite to save Liddil from execution. Fearing Jesse's likely reaction, the Fords conspire to cover up Hite's disappearance. Charley's unconvincing lies drive the characters on an unrelenting path toward a bloody incident. They pre-emptively strike when Jesse inexplicably dis-arms in their presence affording Bob the opportunity to define the story's title with a less than heroic act. The Ford brothers' ignominious act spawns an unexpected notoriety that they shamelessly exploit. Finally, the mantle of cowardice and the growing perception of James as a folk hero gradually alienate and ultimately destroy the brothers.
