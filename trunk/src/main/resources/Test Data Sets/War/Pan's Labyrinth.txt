An unseen narrator (Pablo Adán) describes how once, in an underground realm devoid of lies or pain, a young princess lived who yearned to see the world above. Eluding her keepers, the princess escaped outside but was blinded by the bright sunlight and all memories of her past were erased. She eventually succumbed to sickness and pain and died but her father, the King, remained hopeful that she would return to her kingdom some day, and he would wait for her until then.It is 1944 and the Spanish Civil War has been over for five years but small groups of guerilla rebels continue to fight against the fascist dictatorship led by Francisco Franco. Captain Vidal (Sergi López) vehemently fights against the rebels living in the wilderness outside the village of Navarra where he and a commune of military personnel have stationed within an old mill. He has summoned his new wife Carmen (Ariadna Gil), heavily pregnant with his child, and her 10 year-old daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) to live with him at the mill. Carmen asks her daughter to call Vidal 'father', as it's only a word and because he's been kind to them but Ofelia refuses, acknowledging only her real father who had been a tailor before passing away years ago. En route to the mill, Carmen requests that the caravan they are traveling in stop due to her weak constitution. Ofelia takes the opportunity to look around and she discovers an old stone sculpture at the edge of the woods upon which a strange stick-like insect appears. Having grown up enchanted by fairy tales, Ofelia asks if the creature is a fairy before her mother calls her back to the car.Arriving at the mill, Carmen is greeted by Vidal and the local Doctor Ferreiro (Álex Angulo). Vidal forces his wife to be led inside in a wheelchair and greets his stepdaughter with silent hostility, scolding her on extending the wrong hand for a handshake. Dr Ferreiro warns Vidal that he shouldn't have summoned his wife since her pregnancy is leaving her very weak but Vidal merely states that he wants his son born where he is, where a new Spain will be born. When Ferreiro asks how Vidal can be so sure his child is a male, Vidal laughs, offended the doctor could think otherwise. Ofelia meanwhile explores the area around the mill and finds an ancient, stone labyrinth. Vidal's housekeeper, Mercedes (Maribel Verdú), kindly advises Ofelia to stay away from the labyrinth since she was always told that fauns inhabited them and are creatures not to be trusted.Ofelia and her mother are shown their rooms and Carmen lies down to rest. When the baby begins to act up, Carmen asks Ofelia to tell him a story to calm him. Ofelia tells the story of a rose that blossomed on a mountaintop and would grant immortality to whomever picked it, but no one dared go near it for fear of its poisonous thorns. And so, the rose withered every night and remained on the mountain alone, forgotten in time.That night, as Ofelia sleeps beside her mother, she is woken by the sound of wings and sits up to see the insect she'd spotted during the ride out to the mill. She pulls out one of her favorite fantasy books and shows the insect a picture of what a fairy looks like. The insect then transforms to mimic the image and beckons Ofelia to follow it. It takes her outside to the labyrinth where, at the center, lies a stone structure in the ground with stairs leading down into an abyss. There, Ofelia meets an old creature who introduces himself as a Faun (Doug Jones, voice: Pablo Adán), half man, half goat and dressed in moss from age. The Faun addresses Ofelia as Princess Moanna, the royal daughter of the underground realm from which she disappeared eons ago, and tells her that he is her servant. He presents her with a book containing instructions for three tasks which, if Ofelia completes them by the full moon, will deem her worthy to return to her kingdom. He explains the first task which instructs Ofelia to confront a monstrous toad that is killing the tree it dwells under and to feed it three stones to retrieve a golden key stored in its stomach. The Faun gives Ofelia the stones in a small bag and she agrees to perform the tasks.Meanwhile, Vidal shaves alone in his room listening to music in between reports from his officers regarding the rebels hiding out in the hills. He decides that, in order to starve out the rebels, all food and supplies in the area will be stored at the mill and anyone from the village in need of anything must provide a ration card. He entrusts Mercedes with the only key to the mill. Ofelia bonds with Mercedes and asks her if she believes in fairies. Mercedes admits that she no longer believes in things she used to as she prepares food for the evening. Vidal plans to host a banquet to properly introduce his wife to the mayor of the town and other dignitaries. Ofelia is called to her room where her mother presents a new dress and shoes that she requests be worn to dinner. While Carmen is smitten by the luxuries provided with their new lifestyle, things they normally would not have, Ofelia merely smiles to keep her mother happy. Carmen is either unaware of or enduring the fact that her husband is a cruel man of war. She loves her daughter, but does not understand Ofelia's passion for fairy tales and her intricate imagination.Before she dresses, Ofelia opens the book the Faun gave her and a map appears on the pages showing her where to find the toad for the first task. She goes outside in her new dress and finds the tree but, before entering the cavern beneath it, takes her dress and shoes off and places them delicately on a branch as the wind blows. Forced to crawl through mud, Ofelia finds the center of the tree where the toad lurks and manages to feed it the three stones. After swallowing them, the toad expels its stomach and deflates, revealing the golden key. Victorious, Ofelia backs out of the tree only to find that it has begun to rain and her new dress and shoes have fallen into the mud.Meanwhile, Carmen attends the dinner banquet with Vidal. Worried about her daughter, she sends Mercedes out to find Ofelia. Mercedes takes a lamp and walks to the edge of the woods, flashing the light in Morse code (to make the rebels aware of her presence) until Ofelia appears, filthy, from the woods. She returns to the house where her mother is shocked that she has ruined her dress and takes her upstairs. Vidal is equally perturbed by Ofelia's appearance but remains at the banquet. In Carmen's absence, Vidal speaks down about her while he discusses his progress against the rebels. The mayor (Juanjo Cucalón) tells Vidal that he was familiar with his father and that the man was honorable and, upon his death, smashed his watch so that his son would know the exact time. Vidal dismisses this claim, saying his father never owned a watch. He is then called away from dinner by one of his soldiers.He is brought outside where his men have captured a father and son suspected of being rebels. The men claim they were hunting rabbits but Vidal isn't convinced. When the young man asserts their innocence, Vidal becomes agitated and takes an empty bottle, smashing it into the young man's face repeatedly, breaking his nose and effectively killing him. The man's father sobs in horror before Vidal shoots him dead. He then takes a look at a knapsack carried by the men and finds a few dead rabbits within. However, unremorseful, he blames his men for not having searched the hunters more thoroughly. As he walks back to the house, he meets with Mercedes and hands her the rabbits, telling her to prepare them for dinner.Carmen scolds Ofelia and tells her that she is to be sent to bed without dinner once she is bathed. Despite her punishment, Ofelia is pleased with her success at completing the first task. Before she gets in the bath, she opens the Faun's book and is horrified to see the pages turn red, as if bleeding. A thud is heard in the bedroom and Ofelia finds her mother collapsed on the floor, hemorrhaging. Doctor Ferreiro is brought in to tend to Carmen and informs Vidal that the outlook for his wife is grim. Vidal orders the doctor to do what he must to save his son, even at the expense of his wife.That night, Ofelia is woken by the fairy once again and taken to the center of the labyrinth where the Faun proclaims that she has yet to begin the second task. Ofelia explains that her mother is not well so the Faun gives her a mandrake root, explaining that, when placed under her mother's bed in a bowl of milk and fed drops of blood, it will improve her health. Ofelia follows the Faun's instructions and places the humanoid mandrake under the bed, biting her own finger to provide it with blood. As soon as the mandrake is settled, Ofelia notices that her sleeping mother seems to fall at ease. By morning, Carmen seems rejuvenated.Meanwhile, Vidal continues his hunt for the rebels in the hills. He takes his men to a location where their last campsite was spotted and sees nothing but ashen logs still smoldering from the fire. However, he does find a small medicine vial.That night, Ofelia is visited in her room by the Faun who asks if her mother is feeling better. Ofelia replies that she is and thanks him. He then gives her explicit instructions for her second task which involves invading the lair of a feared monster and retrieving a golden dagger. Above all things, Ofelia must not eat any of the food that she will find laid out on a table within. She must collect the dagger and make her way back to her room before the last grain of sand falls within an hourglass. The Faun gives her three fairies to aid her before she uses a magic chalk to carve out a doorway in the wall of her room. As she enters the lair, she flips the hourglass over to begin her timed trial. She walks to a large room where a bounty of food is set out on a large table. At the head of the table sits a Pale Man (Doug Jones), motionless and with his eyes set on a plate in front of him. Ofelia finds that the creature is immobile and doesn't respond to her presence. On the walls she sees hideous images of the Pale Man devouring children. On the far wall are three cabinet doors, variously made of gold, silver, and wood. Using the key she retrieved from the toad, Ofelia approaches the doors to open one. The fairies point to the golden door to match the golden key but Ofelia hesitates, instead correctly choosing the humbler wooden door. She finds the dagger inside and stuffs it into her knapsack. As she leaves, she pauses beside the table and eyes a platter of grapes. Enchanted by the food and very hungry, she ignores the warnings of the fairies (believing them untrustworthy because of their choice of the door), picks a grape, and eats it. Behind her, the Pale Man stirs and puts his clawed hands down on the eyeballs, imbedding them in his palms and holding them up to see. Ofelia eats another grape before she turns to see the Pale Man approaching her. The fairies try to distract the creature but he grabs two of them and eats them. Horrified, Ofelia runs with the last fairy down the hall to see the chalked doorway closing; she's too late. However, just before the Pale Man can reach her, she manages to draw another doorway in the ceiling and barely escapes back into her room.Mercedes makes her way to the edge of the woods, a bundle under her arms. She walks out to the abandoned rebel campsite and is suddenly surrounded by rebels. However, she greets them as family and hugs the leader Pedro (Roger Casamajor), her brother. They bring her back to their hideout where Mercedes distributes various food and supplies she stole from the mill. One of the rebels, Francés (Gonzalo Uriarte), is suffering a from an infection in his leg from a bullet wound. Doctor Ferreiro is on site and he determines that the leg must be amputated. Though he willingly provides aid to the rebels, Ferreiro does not believe that they will win the fight against the government.The Faun revisits Ofelia in her room and she gives him the dagger but explains that something went wrong. She releases her third fairy guide who relays Ofelia's disobedience to the Faun. He admonishes her for her recklessness and tells her that, with the full moon only three days away, she may never prove herself worthy of returning to her kingdom, and he will return to the darkness forgotten, never to be seen again. He leaves Ofelia alone, crestfallen.The next day, the mill is rocked by sounds of explosions and gunfire. Vidal conjures his men and they race into the woods to fight the attacking rebels. However, this seems to be a decoy for the rebels' true motive. Vidal returns to the mill to find that it is devoid of most of the supplies stored there. He also sees that, while the rebels were clearly armed with enough explosives, the door of the mill was left unscathed and the lock was not tampered with. This leads him to suspect Mercedes since she had the only key. He questions her, but she assures him that she alone possesses the only copy. A rebel is then caught by Vidal's men and is brought into the mill with a bag over his head. Concerned for her brother, Mercedes rushes over to the mill in time to see that Pedro has not been captured; it is instead their friend, Tarta (Ivan Massagué).Vidal brings out tools of torture to intimidate Tarta to talking about the location of the rebels. Tarta will not be easily swayed but Vidal takes amusement in noticing that the man stutters horribly. He proposes a deal; if Tarta can count to three without stuttering, he will be set free. Vidal addresses his second-in-command, Garcés (Manolo Solo), who confirms Vidal's honesty and power to release him. However, Tarta stutters on three. Vidal muses that that's a shame before he begins to beat him. Vidal then collects Doctor Ferreiro to take a look at the man; he wants him healthy enough to continue torture. He then goes to his room, leaving the doctor and Tarta alone. Ferreiro, immediately recognizing Tarta, expresses his apologies but Tarta begs for a lethal dose of morphine, explaining that he talked some. The doctor obliges.In his room, Vidal discovers an identical medicine vial from Doctor Ferreiro as the one found in the woods at the abandoned rebel camp.Meanwhile, Ofelia checks on the mandrake beneath her mother's bed. The creature is still and Ofelia worries if it's all right until a pair of rough hands pulls her out from under the bed. Vidal demands to know what Ofelia was doing and finds the mandrake, taking it from its bowl. He angrily shows it to Carmen, telling her that this is what her daughter's imagination has led her to. He shoves the mandrake into Carmen's hands before angrily leaving. Carmen tells Ofelia that she's been very foolish despite Ofelia's assertions that the mandrake is what made Carmen feel better. However, Carmen despondently tosses the mandrake into the fireplace, saying that fairy tales and magic exist for no one. As the mandrake burns and screams in the flames, Carmen suddenly bowels over in pain and clutches her belly. Ofelia shouts for help.Vidal returns to the mill outside to see that Doctor Ferreiro has euthanized the rebel. When asked why he's chosen to help the rebels, Ferreiro tells Vidal that he, unlike some men, does not simply obey for obedience's sake before he begins to walk away. Infuriated, Vidal shoots the doctor in the back, killing him. At that moment, a maid runs from the house to tell Vidal that his wife is in labor. With the doctor dead, a military medic is forced to deliver the baby. Carmen dies in childbirth but the infant, a son, is alive and healthy. Vidal, cradling his son, and Ofelia attend Carmen's funeral the next day. Vidal keeps the baby in his quarters.Mercedes comforts the orphaned Ofelia and hums to her a tune she's since forgotten the words to. Ofelia asks if Mercedes is helping the rebels but says she hasn't told anyone and won't speak a word of it. Mercedes is then summoned to Vidal's room where she is questioned again about the mill key. Sensing that she is in danger, Mercedes vows to leave that night. She bids farewell to Ofelia who begs to be taken with her. Mercedes begrudgingly agrees and takes Ofelia with her out into the woods. Before they can get very far, they are confronted by Vidal and his men and are brought back to the mill. Mercedes is bound and locked inside the mill while Vidal locks Ofelia in her room, slapping her across the face and asking her how long she's known about Mercedes' treachery. As he leaves the room, he orders his captain to kill her if anyone tries to free her. Ofelia breaks down in tears.As dawn begins to break, Vidal goes to the mill and gathers his instruments of torture. Using a small, paring knife she always carries to cut through her binds, Mercedes stabs Vidal once in the back, in the shoulder, and then sticks the knife in his mouth. She tells him that if he harms Ofelia, he won't be the first pig she's gutted. She then slits Vidal's cheek open and exits the mill, doing her best to stay composed as she passes the guards and walks towards the woods. When Vidal finally emerges from the mill, his mouth agape in a Glasgow smile, he orders his men to bring her back. They pursue Mercedes on horseback into the woods where, at a clearing and surrounded, she threatens to slit her throat. Garcés calmly dismounts and tells her that if anyone is to kill her, he'd rather it be him. Suddenly, shots ring out and all of Vidal's men are killed. The rebels led by Pedro emerge from the trees and Mercedes rushes to embrace him.That night, Ofelia is visited again by the Faun. He consoles her and tells her that he's decided to give her one last chance. He instructs her to fetch her brother and take him into the labyrinth. Ofelia escapes her room using the magic chalk and makes her way to Vidal's quarters. Vidal, who has finished suturing the wound in his cheek, does not notice Ofelia sneak in and drug his scotch with some sedatives. As he drinks, gunfire and explosions erupt as the rebels begin a second attack. As he begins feeling the effects of the drugs, he sees Ofelia in the doorway holding her brother. He runs after her as she races to the labyrinth, but falls behind in the chaos and from the dizzying effects of the sedatives.Meanwhile, Mercedes frantically searches for Ofelia amid the rebel attack.Ofelia makes it to the center of the labyrinth with her brother where she meets the Faun. He asks her to hand to him her brother, but she hesitates when she sees that the Faun is holding the dagger she collected during her second task. The Faun tries to assure her that he only needs a small prick of blood from an innocent in order to open the portal to Moanna's kingdom but Ofelia is not convinced. She refuses to hand her brother over and the Faun angrily states that the full moon is high in the sky and that the time to act is now. However, Ofelia stubbornly refuses to obey. Vidal enters the labyrinth and finds his way to the center, seeing Ofelia talking to nothing but the wind as she tells the Faun that she'd rather remain mortal to protect her brother despite all the pain that his existence has brought her. The Faun relents and backs away as Vidal approaches Ofelia from behind and snatches the baby from her arms. He then aims his gun at Ofelia and shoots her, leaving her for dead. Ofelia collapses as her blood seeps onto the labyrinth stonework. It drips down the stone stairs and pools into a spiral fixture.Vidal exits the labyrinth only to come face to face with the victorious rebels led by Pedro and Mercedes. Acknowledging his defeat, Vidal hands his son over to them and requests that they tell the child who his father was and what time he died. Mercedes steps forward and tells Vidal that the child will not even know his father's name. Pedro shoots Vidal, killing him.Mercedes runs into the labyrinth to find Ofelia dying. The rebels watch as Mercedes comforts Ofelia in her last moments, humming to her the same tune she once did before. Ofelia's eyes glaze as a light comes over her face. She suddenly finds herself standing in a wide room before an image of her father, sitting high on a throne beside her mother. The Faun appears and tells Ofelia that her choice to spare her brother was the right one; that was the final test to prove that she truly is Princess Moanna. The blood of an innocent was her own that she spilled in lieu of her brother and, for that, she has earned the right to sit by her father's side and rule over her kingdom. The court applauds the reappearance of their lost princess.In the real world, Ofelia smiles as the light in her eyes fades. Mercedes weeps over her body but an ending monologue describes how Princess Moanna, reunited with her kingdom, ruled over her people with kindness and wisdom for centuries. However, this is left to the audience to decide whether what transpired actually happened or if it was part of the last gasp of Ofelia's vivid imagination before dying.
