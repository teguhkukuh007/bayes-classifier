  "data": "More Golf: Leaderboard | Rankings | Schedule | Equipment | FedEx CupI\u0027ve been using the Cobra AMP Cell irons all summer and fall and just haven\u0027t gotten around to posting anything on them yet.I\u0027ve really been pleased with their performance, however, and decided to do a little Q\u0026A to celebrate.What\u0027s your favorite thing about the clubs?I\u0027m not that good at golf but these things are easy to hit. I especially love the high irons and wedges -- I\u0027ve probably hit the gap wedge more than all the other clubs in my bag combined this year. It\u0027s my ultimate \"oh crap, what am I doing, I need to get out of this\" club.Do they look good?They\u0027re fantastic. They come in silver, orange, blue, and red and I have the silvers. For a company so brash at times with its attire, they sure do make a slick-looking club.Do you have a video?Yes, I\u0027m glad you asked!These three goofballs all love the clubs, too.Where can I buy these?How about at Cobra Golf. And are they costly?Nope, on sale for $499So how would you rank them?8/10Wait, eight? I thought you said you loved them?I do love them but they aren\u0027t the best irons in the world. I think they\u0027re a little bit underrated -- and a great value right now at $499 -- and I\u0027m going to keep using them. But there\u0027s room for improvement which is why I can\u0027t wait to see what Cobra comes out with next.For more golf news, rumors and analysis, follow @EyeOnGolf and @KylePorterCBS on Twitter or Google+ and like us on Facebook.",
