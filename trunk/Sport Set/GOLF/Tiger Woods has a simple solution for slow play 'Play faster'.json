  "data": "  Tiger Woods wants you to hurry up. (USATSI) More Golf: Leaderboard | Rankings | Schedule | Expert Picks | Equipment | FedEx CupIt\u0027s the slow time of the golf season but all golfers seem to want to talk about is speeding up pace of play on the PGA Tour.Brandt Snedeker discussed it in his interview with Golf Digest and said the PGA Tour needs to start penalizing golfer a shot for playing so slow.Tiger Woods said he would take a different approach.\"It\u0027s one of those things where I don\u0027t know, at our level, the tour level, it\u0027s easy to fix: just start fining guys.  At the local level, it\u0027s a little more difficult, more complicated.\"The irony of Woods, a multimillionaire hundreds of times over, saying that fining guys would help stop slow playing is quite thick.I tend to agree with Snedeker that the real way to stop it (or speed it up) is to start adding strokes. That will speed up the process, so to speak, very quickly.Woods thinks it\u0027s an issue with younger generations just not understanding what golf is supposed to be.\"I think it\u0027s grassroots. People just quite aren\u0027t educated about pace of play.\"Either way I agree with Woods on the simple solution to slow play in this sport. It\u0027s not that difficult as Wood succinctly put it.\"Play faster.\"Woods isn\u0027t all talk either. When asked how fast he usually plays he gave a pretty stunning response.\"Thirty six holes usually takes us under three-and-a-half hours. I\u0027ve played under an hour 18 holes no problem. It helps having a fast cart.\"It probably also helps hitting every fairway and green.
