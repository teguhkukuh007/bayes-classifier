  "data": "  Kobe Bryant will miss the season opener, his coach says. (USATSI) Following the Lakers\u0027 final preseason game of the season four days before the season opener Tuesday vs. the Clippers, coach Mike D\u0027Antoni finally put the matter to rest. Kobe Bryant will not play. D\u0027Antoni finally rules Kobe out definitively for the season opener Tuesday.— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) October 26, 2013Bryant tore his Achilles in April and has endeavored to return as soon as possible. There have been mixed signals as to his progress for months, but recent indications were that it was unlikely he would play. Both Bryant\u0027s friend Brian Shaw and D\u0027Antoni have said this month they didn\u0027t think he would play vs. the Clippers. Bryant said on October 14th if a preseason game to be played that week were a playoff game, he\u0027d play.It\u0027s not a big deal, Bryant said earlier this month he didn\u0027t understand the fuss, that he\u0027d be ready when he\u0027s ready. The odds are good that Bryant will be back before the end of November. He won\u0027t be gone long enough to significantly alter the Lakers\u0027 season one way or the other. But on opening night, the legend will not suit up. It turns out there is a limit to what Bryant can do after all. ",
