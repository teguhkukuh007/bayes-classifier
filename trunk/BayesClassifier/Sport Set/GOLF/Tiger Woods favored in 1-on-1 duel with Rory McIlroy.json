  "data": "  Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods will hook up again in China. (USATSI) More Golf: Leaderboard | Rankings | Schedule | Equipment | FedEx CupIt\u0027s a very rare thing that Tiger Woods isn\u0027t the favorite on a golf course and his one-on-one matchup with Rory McIlroy in China at the end of this week is no different.Woods and McIlroy will tee it up on Monday (Sunday in US time) at Mission Hills which is, according to the Guiness Book of World Records, the largest golf resort in the world.Here are their official odds for the event:Woods: -150McIlroy: +150For those of you not accustomed to reading betting lines that means you have to bet $150 on Tiger to win $100 and you only have to bet $100 on McIlroy to win $150. Woods took down the Ulsterman last year 67-68 in a pretty tightly-contested matchup. These types of events are so hard to predict I wouldn\u0027t advise either guy with any kind of certainty but it does seem like in a one-on-one scenario McIlroy at +150 is the better value.For more golf news, rumors and analysis, follow @EyeOnGolf and @KylePorterCBS on Twitter or Google+ and like us on Facebook.",
