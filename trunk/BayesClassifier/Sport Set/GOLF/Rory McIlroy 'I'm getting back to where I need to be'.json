(Getty Images) More Golf: Leaderboard | Rankings | Schedule | Expert Picks | Equipment | FedEx CupRory McIlroy finished tied for second in the Kolon Korea Open last weekend which matters because McIlroy hasn\u0027t finished second in much of anything lately, unless you count his tennis matches with Caroline Wozniacki.After his final round he said he was back to that old gunslingin\u0027 Rory self.\"I could have shot anything, absolutely anything,\" he said.\"I only missed two greens and had so many chances, but it was like the story of yesterday -- I just didn\u0027t hole enough putts.\"He finished the tournament 3 under and one back of the eventual winner (who won under very unusual circumstances, by the way).He also told BBC he was starting to feel his game again.\"I feel like I\u0027m getting back to where I need to be and I\u0027m excited about these next two weeks in China. They\u0027re two big weeks for me to get a little bit of momentum for the end of the season and going into 2014.\"I\u0027m certainly hoping for a better 2014 for McIlroy than his 2013. Golf is better when its stars are shining and nobody\u0027s burns brighter outside the Tiger Woods galaxy than McIlroy\u0027s.Also, I was recently reminded of how small McIlroy actually is!For more golf news, rumors and analysis, follow @EyeOnGolf and @KylePorterCBS on Twitter or Google+ and like us on Facebook.",
