  "data": "More Golf: Leaderboard | Rankings | Schedule | Expert Picks | Equipment | FedEx CupI got a nice little surprise in the mail a few weeks ago when Nike sent me its new HyperAdapt Golf jacket. I love getting new golf equipment and especially when I don\u0027t know it\u0027s coming.You can see how sharp it looks above but let me tell you a little bit more about it with a quick equipment Q\u0026A.What\u0027s your favorite thing about it?Somehow it\u0027s both light and heavy at the same time. I would wear it in 65-degree weather and 30-degree weather. It\u0027s flexible and waterproof so you\u0027re good to go for pretty much any kind of weather you incur on the course.Does it look good?Absolutely. I\u0027m a pretty traditional guy when it comes to style on and off the course (not a big fan of Rickie Fowler\u0027s closet) and this fits the bill. The jacket Nike sent me is actually the most modern of its three designs and I think all three are really strong looks.Do you have more photos?Yes, let\u0027s jump in.Here\u0027s the box Nike sent it in. It\u0027s really heavy and a created a strong first impression.This is at the top of the zipper part, up by the beck. It\u0027s my favorite part of the jacket.I love the neon outlines.Like I said, any kind of weather.Where can I buy it?Right here at the Nike store.How much does it cost?$280, and worth every penny.So how would you rank it?9/10For more golf news, rumors and analysis, follow @EyeOnGolf and @KylePorterCBS on Twitter or Google+ and like us on Facebook.",
