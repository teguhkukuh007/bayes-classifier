  "title": "Oliver Stone, John Cusack star in anti-NSA PSA",
  "data": " Oliver Stone and John Cusack are no fans of the National Security Agency.  They appear with Maggie Gyllenhaal, Wil Wheaton and Phil Donahue in a new public service announcement decrying the NSA\u0027s surveillance tactics on Americans.  \"Every American is at risk of getting caught up in the NSA dragnet,\" Stone said, with Cusack adding, \"including ordinary citizens not suspected of a crime.\"   The PSA also includes social activists, scholars and NSA whistleblowers, many of whom draw parallels with today\u0027s monitoring to the way Richard Nixon spied on journalists and political foes during his presidency.  \"It was wrong then and it\u0027s wrong now,\" Cusack says in the PSA, which was produced in the lead-up to the Stop Watching Us: Rally Against Mass Surveillance in Washington, D.C. on Saturday.  Much of the NSA\u0027s surveillance tactics were brought to the public\u0027s attention by Edward Snowden.  Another strong critic of the NSA has been WikiLeaks\u0027 Julian Assange, portrayed by actor Benedict Cumberbatch in the new film, \"The Fifth Estate,\" now out in theaters.    ",
