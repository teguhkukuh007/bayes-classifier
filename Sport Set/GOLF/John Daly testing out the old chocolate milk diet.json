  "data": "  John Daly is playing well in China this week. (Getty Images) More Golf: Leaderboard | Rankings | Schedule | Equipment | FedEx CupJohn Daly is back playing golf for the first time since July and, wouldn\u0027t you know it, he\u0027s actually playing pretty well. Daly ripped up his right elbow earlier this year and had to take a break from golf four three months after surgery.He shot a 68 in the first round of the BMW Masters and followed that up with a decent 74 and currently sits T9, six shots behind leader Luke Guthrie.Golf.com noted that he looked like he weighed a little bit more than he did during the summer when he was playing PGA Tour events. Daly said that was on purpose though -- he was trying to regain some of his strength.So how did he do it?\"I drank a ton of Vitamin D milk,\" Daly said. \"My mom always told me the old remedy was to drink a lot of milk. But I put a lot of chocolate syrup in mine.\"Apparently food was on the mind, too, because later when asked if he wore red, yellow, and black pants in honor of Germany (the German-based BMW is the title sponsor of the event).\"No disrespect to the Germans,\" he said, \"but we call it ketchup and mustard.\"Yep, John Daly is definitely back at it.For more golf news, rumors and analysis, follow @EyeOnGolf and @KylePorterCBS on Twitter or Google+ and like us on Facebook.",
