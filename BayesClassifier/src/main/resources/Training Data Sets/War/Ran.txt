Akira Kurosawa's treatment of King Lear, with three sons dealing
with the passing of an era as their warlord father Lord Hidetora
Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), tries to find peace in his last years by dividing his fief among them. While one honest son, Saburo Naotora Ichimonji (Daisuke Ryu), faces his family's wrath for speaking the truth, his two brothers, Taro Takatora Ichimonji and Jiro Masatora Ichimonji (Akira Terao, Jinpachi Nezu) vie for power
in the vacuum left by Hidetora's retirement. While Kyoami the Court
Fool (Peter) makes wise commentary, Hidetora discovers for
himself the madness caused by his thirst for power, and tries to find
redemption for his deadly past.
