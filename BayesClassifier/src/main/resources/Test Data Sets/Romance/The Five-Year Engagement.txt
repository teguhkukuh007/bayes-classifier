Exactly one year after Tom Solomon met Violet Barnes, he is surprising her with a ring. Toms plan is simple: As they head out to a New Years Eve party, he fakes a reason to drop by work. The staff patio at the über-trendy Birch, with its view of San Franciscos Bay Bridge, is the perfect place to pop the question. Tom is nervous as hell, but the candles are lit, the champagne is chilled and his best friend, Alex is in on the secret. But theyre late for the party, so Violet fights him on the pit stop. Frustrated, he blurts out his agenda, and suddenlytheyre engaged!By all accounts, Tom and Violet are destined for their happily ever after. As a sous chef at Birch, Tom is at the apex of modernist cooking and ripe for a promotion. Academia is Violets life, and shes this close to a postdoctoral assignment in social psychology at UC Berkeley. Theres nothing she cant handle with ease, and shell spearhead wedding logistics. Theyll be married in no time at all.Scoring the perfect wedding venue is a headache, but much more painful is Violets rejection by her dream
school. When the University of Michigan beckons, shes conflicted. But Tom swallows his pride and tells her to
go for it. He can cook in Michigan for two years; theyll just have to postpone the wedding for a bit.In Ann Arbor, Violet thrives under the tutelage of brilliant faculty advisor Winton and makes quick friends with her fellow grad studentsDoug, Vaneetha and Ming. Left with too much time on his hands, Tom settles into Michigan life and gets a job at Zingermans Deli, a local institution but a far cry from the fine dining he is used to. He bonds with his co-worker Tarquin and takes up hunting at the behest of the other faculty spouse, Bill. Back in San Francisco, Alex gets the restaurant promotion that should have been Toms and marries Violets quirky sister, Suzie. They quickly have two kids while Tom and Violet still dont have a wedding date. Life seems to be working out so easily for everyone else. Two people who once dreamed of the perfect day just want to get it over with. But even that seems beyond them, as comical problems torpedo every save the date. Maybe its not meant to be. Maybe theyre not meant to be. Now, through the humorous trials of discovering who they will become as a couple, Tom and Violet will learn if they have what it takes to survive their five-year engagement.
