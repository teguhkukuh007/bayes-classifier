The story begins on Isla Nublar, a small island 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica. A large group of construction workers and animal handlers offload a large container, the creature within unseen. During the process, the animal attempts to escape, an act which leads to a mass panic, and the death of one of the workers.The narrative jumps forward to an Amber mine in the Dominican Republic, where we learn that miners extracting amber are involved with a genetic-engineering company called InGen.From here, we jump to a paleontological excavation in Montana, where we are introduced to our main heroes, Dr. Alan Grant, and his assistant Ellie Sattler, as they slowly uncover the fossilized remains of a VELOCIRAPTOR, perhaps nature's most lethal and cunning predator to date, a beautiful specimen evolved to kill.The dig is cut short by the sudden appearance of Grant and Sattler's main sponsor, the elderly and eccentric billionaire, John Hammond. He invites them over to endorse his latest project, a remote island resort, where he claims "the attractions are guaranteed to drive children out their minds!"Grant and Sattler are acompanied by two other characters-the equally eccentric chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm, and Hammond's lawyer, Donald Genarro. As they arrive by helicopter, they are treated to a unique spectacle of living, breathing DINOSAURS, creatures beyond your wildest imagination, resurrected from the dead and roaming a special zoological environment built to sustain them! Just the sight of these mighty beasts, a towering BRACHIOSAURUS accompanied by a herd of PARASAUROLOPHUS is enough to leave the stunned visitors breathless, save for Gennaro's offhand comment: "we're gonna make a fortune off this place...a fortune...".Later, as they arrive at the island's central resort and control facility, the visitors are given a brief tour of the process. InGen has succeeded in cloning animals from simple strands of DNA salvaged from mosquitoes fed on dinosaur blood, and preserved for untold millions of years inside fossilized amber. The group is shown the egg-incubation room, just in time to witness the birth of a baby VELOCIRAPTOR, a sight that deeply disturbs Grant. He demands to see where the adults are housed......and we are shown the special containment facility seen in the introduction, a fortress of electrified fences and dense foliage, all that separates the humans from the most dangerous creature on the island. Grant is witness to the daily feeding of the animals: a cow is lowered into the pit, only to be stripped clean within a moment. The audience is spared the gruesome sight of this daily job...The group prepares to experience the theme park's central attraction, the DINOSAUR TOUR, in which visitors embark on a safari-like tour of the park, on special electrified Ford Explorers. Grant, Sattler, Malcolm and Gennaro are accompanied by Hammond's two grand children: Lex and her little brother Tim. As the group heads off, Hammond settles into the main control room where his two computer experts, Arnold and Nedry, manage the complex infrastructure of the park.The tour is largely un-eventful: the T-REX and DILOPHOSAURUS-two extremely dangerous carnivores- refuse to reveal themselves to the eager tourists. A sick triceratops is also encountered, tended to by the park vetrinarians, whom Sattler leaves the group to help out with. An approaching tropical storm forces the tour to be cut short, as most of the staff leave by ship for the mainland.In the meantime, we learn the true colours of Nedry-hired to steal dinosaur embryoes for InGen's close competitor, BioSyn. His plot results in the failure of security systems throughout the park: the electric cars break down, and the electrified fences shut down.In the film's most thrilling sequence, a T-REX escapes it's enclosure and proceeds to wreck the tour vehicles. Gennaro is eaten, Malcolm is critically injured, but Grant escapes with the terrified children. In the meantime, a lost and confused Nedry, trying to meet his contact, encounters a venom-spitting DILOPHOSAURUS, and justice is dealt.Sattler and the Park Warden Muldoon arrive in a jeep at the site of the T-REX attack to find the injured Malcolm and the remains of Gennarro, but everyone else has disappeared. The T-REX returns to give chase to the jeep down the road in an exciting car chase of an action sequence, but the humans eventually escape.Grant and the kids spend the night sheltering up a tree, wake up to find a BRACHIOSAURUS grazing nearby. Once more, we are given the oppurtunity to appreciate the beauty and majesty of these creatures.With Malcolm injured and park systems still offline, Arnold is forced to take drastic action and reset the system-an act that has the unintended consequences of freeing the RAPTORS from their enclosure. Arnold, Muldoon and Sattler attempt to restore power, only to have Arnold and Muldoon outsmarted and killed by the cunning creatures.After witnessing a GALLIMIMUS stampede, Grant and the kids make it back to the main resort complex, only to find it abandoned. Grant leaves the kids in the main dining area, and tries to contact other survivors. In the meantime, Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of RAPTORS inside the main kitchen. One is trapped inside the freezer, but the other gives chase to the kids.Meeting up in the control room, Grant, Sattler, and the kids attempt to restore power and communications to the park, but are trapped in by the same RAPTOR. In the nick of time, the security systems and phone lines are brought back online.Eventually, our heroes are cornered by the last two RAPTORS inside the main atrium. Just as all is lost, the T-REX crashes in and attacks the RAPTORS, buying enough time for the small group of humans to escape.As the humans evacuate the island by helicopter, the T-REX gives a final victory roar behind a falling banner proclaiming: WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH!!!
