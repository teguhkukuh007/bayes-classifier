  "data": "  A Wisconsin kid\u0027s worn an Aaron Rodgers jersey for three-straight years. (Via News8000.com) Packers fans are a dedicated bunch. But David Pehl laughs at every other Cheesehead. Pehl, a 6th-grader from Holmen, Wisconsin, has worn an Aaron Rodgers jersey for more than 1,000 consecutive days.Think about that. 1,000 days (technically he\u0027s closer to 1,050) is almost THREE YEARS of wearing the same shirt -- a jersey no less -- day in and day out. Pehl\u0027s shooting to break a record set by someone wearing a Brett Favre jersey for more than four years.His parents sound just thrilled.\"Everyone asks, \u0027Is he still wearing the shirt?\u0027 Yes, he\u0027s still wearing the shirt,\" Jessica, his mother, said.The best part, though? They\u0027re all Vikings fans.\"Being a Viking family we tried to convert him, but once we knew he wasn\u0027t going to convert we said OK,\" David\u0027s father, Dave, said. The dad helped paint a \"Packers sanctuary\" (see: above) for the kid, but did it while wearing a Vikings jersey, so at least, if nothing else, he\u0027s a good parent.\"I thought a year maybe, and here we are almost three years later and he\u0027s still doing it,\" Dave said.Adding to the fun for them is a) the need to hand wash the jersey every other night (to avoid the stink) and b) their youngest son\u0027s now decided to try and wear a Vikings jersey for four-straight years.At least their house doesn\u0027t smell like teen spirit.Wink of the CBS Eye to Bleacher/Report for the link",
