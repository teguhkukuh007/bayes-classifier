  "data": "  Roger Goodell wants teams in \u0027both\u0027 Los Angeles and London. (USATSI) The Jaguars and 49ers are about 24 hours away from kicking off in London and, as such, the topic of a team overseas is once again at the forefront of the NFL discussion. But would the league prefer a franchise in London or a franchise back in Los Angeles?Speaking at a fan forum for Euro NFLers on Saturday, Goodell said he wants \"both\" and he doesn\u0027t care which one happens first.\"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Goodell said. \"I\u0027d love to be back in Los Angeles. But it has to be done the right way, we have to do it successfully ... \"I want both [London and LA], but it doesn\u0027t matter which one is first.\"It almost feels like an inevitability that we eventually get both. After all, what Roger Goodell wants Roger Goodell -- and the NFL -- usually gets. This is where the league is smart though. It could force the issue and get a team in LA and a team in London in the next half decade.Goodell understands that it \"has to be done the right way,\" and the right way is hard to pull off. The transition needs to appear somewhat seamless and it needs to keep the enjoyable nature of the NFL uninterrupted.It appears that the fans overseas are quite amenable to bringing a franchise to London. And Goodell certainly thinks their \"worthy\" of a team.\"You are proving you are worthy of a franchise,\" Goodell said.Now they just have to exhibit another important virtue: patience.",
