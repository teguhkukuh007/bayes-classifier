  "data": "Portland Trail Blazers forward LaMarcus Aldridge told Yahoo Sports that he expects, nay, guarantees the Blazers will be at least the No. 7 seed in the West. Blazers forward @aldridge_12 projects his team will finish seventh in the West. \"Mark my words,\" LaMarcus Aldridge told Yahoo.— Marc J. Spears (@SpearsNBAYahoo) October 25, 2013We noted earlier this week how the Blazers\u0027 over/under according to sportsbooks is crazy, and we talked about it more on the podcast. Their starting lineup was the third best in plus/minus last year, and that was with J.J. Hickson who they upgraded on with Robin Lopez this summer. They just needed a bench, and they have that in droves. Portland is set to make a run.The questions will be about their defense, especially with some younger players in the rotation. But the same can be said for other teams near that West middle, like the Lakers, Pelicans, Timberwolves, and Nuggets. They need some things to break their way, but there are also reasons to get behind the Blazer as a playoff team. Aldridge isn\u0027t one for bold proclamations. He knows he\u0027s got reason to be as confident as he is. ",
