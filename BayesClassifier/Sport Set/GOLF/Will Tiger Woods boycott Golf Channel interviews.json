  "data": "  How will Tiger Woods respond? (USATSI) More Golf: Leaderboard | Rankings | Schedule | Expert Picks | Equipment | FedEx CupThe Tiger Woods-Brandel Chamblee rift is going to be pretty fascinating to follow over the next few months. Late last week, as you know, Chamblee essentially called Woods a cheater. Woods\u0027 agent responded by saying they might pursue legal action. And now Ed Sherman wonders if Woods will just boycott Golf Channel interview (where Chamblee works).\"Woods, though, will be looking to get even, and that could put the Golf Channel in the line of fire. There\u0027s not much he can do to get back at Golf.com. The magazine and site weren\u0027t getting any exclusive interviews anyway.\"Woods, though, does appear regularly on interviews during tournaments with the Golf Channel. Chamblee\u0027s main work is with the Golf Channel.\"I wouldn\u0027t rule out the possibility that Woods might pull an interview boycott with the Golf Channel–at least at the events where Chamblee is on site as an analyst, which are quite a few. It would be a way for the Woods camp to make Chamblee feel the heat.\"That would be crazy and, honestly, entertaining as hell. Though I don\u0027t really think it will happen.Can you imagine a camera following Tiger who is trying to avoid all Golf Channel reporters en route to his other interviews as well as the clubhouse?That would be more exciting than most of the fall tournaments.For more golf news, rumors and analysis, follow @EyeOnGolf and @KylePorterCBS on Twitter or Google+ and like us on Facebook.",
