  "data": " \n\n\nPeggy Sirota/Rolling Stone\n\n Time heals many things, and that includes Paul McCartney\u0027s rift with John Lennon\u0027s widow, Yoko Ono.  In a new interview with Rolling Stone, the former Beatle says his long-bitter relationship with Ono has improved.  Describing her as a \"badass,\" McCartney tells the magazine he\u0027s moved on. \"I thought, \u0027If John loved her, there\u0027s got to be something. He\u0027s not stupid,\u0027\" he explained. \"It\u0027s like, what are you going to do? Are you going to hold a grudge you never really had?\"  Lennon is still a presence in his mind, and he still \"consults\" with his late songwriting partner to this day. \"If I\u0027m at a point where I go, \u0027I\u0027m not sure about this,\u0027 I\u0027ll throw it across the room to John,\" McCartney, 71, revealed. \"He\u0027ll say, \u0027You can\u0027t go there, man.\u0027 And I\u0027ll say, \u0027You\u0027re quite right.\u0027 ... We\u0027ll have a conversation.\"  And it was another ex-Beatle that helped McCartney decide to let go of his feud with Ono.  \"George [Harrison] would say to me, \u0027You don\u0027t want stuff like that hanging around in your life,\u0027\" he said.  But there\u0027s one person McCartney says he can\u0027t forgive -- Mark David Chapman, the man who fatally shot Lennon outside his New York apartment building in 1980.  \"I think I could pretty much forgive anyone else,\" he said in the interview. \"But I don\u0027t see why I\u0027d want to forgive him. This is a guy who did something so crazy and terminal. Why should I bless him with forgiveness?\"   McCartney\u0027s latest album, \"New,\" was released earlier this month. The new issue of Rolling Stone hits newsstands Friday.   ",
