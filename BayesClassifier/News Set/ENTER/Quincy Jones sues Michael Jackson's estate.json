  "data": " LOS ANGELES Quincy Jones sued Michael Jackson\u0027s estate on Friday claiming he is owed millions in royalties and production fees on some of the superstar\u0027s greatest hits. \t Jones\u0027 lawsuit seeks at least $10 million from the singer\u0027s estate and Sony Music Entertainment, claiming the entities improperly re-edited songs to deprive him of royalties and production fees. The music has been used in the film \"This Is It\" and a pair of Cirque du Soleil shows based on the King of Pop\u0027s songs, the lawsuit states. \t Jones also claims that he should have received a producer\u0027s credit on the music in \"This Is It.\" His lawsuit seeks an accounting of the estate\u0027s profits from the works so that Jones can determine how much he is owed. \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21 Photos\nMichael Jackson: 1958-2009\n\n\nThe producer worked with Jackson on three of his most popular solo albums, \"Off the Wall,\" \u0027\u0027Thriller\" and \"Bad.\" \t Jackson\u0027s estate wrote in a statement that it was saddened by Jones\u0027 lawsuit. \"To the best of its knowledge, Mr. Jones has been appropriately compensated over approximately 35 years for his work with Michael,\" the statement said. \t An after-hours message left at Sony Music\u0027s New York offices was not immediately returned. \t Jackson\u0027s hits \"Billie Jean,\" \u0027\u0027Thriller\" and \"Don\u0027t Stop \u0027Til You Get Enough\" are among the songs Jones claims were re-edited to deprive him of royalties and his producer\u0027s fee. \t Jones\u0027 lawsuit states the producer\u0027s contracts called for him to have the first opportunity to re-edit or alter the songs, in part to protect his reputation.
