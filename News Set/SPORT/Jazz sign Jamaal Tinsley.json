  "data": "  The Jazz added Jamaal Tinsley. (USATSI) When rookie Trey Burke went down with a broken finger during preseason, the Utah Jazz needed a point guard. They were exploring options and on Saturday finalized the solution they came up. They signed veteran point guard Jamaal Tinsley, the team announced. Tinsley averaged four points and four assists last season for the Jazz in 19 minutes of play. He\u0027ll help them a stabilizing force both on the court and in the locker room. There\u0027s no real downside here, especially considering he had four games with over ten assists last season. HT: HoopsRumors.com",
